## Runaway - Kanye West

I've heard something that goes like, "Runaway" is the hip-hop equivalent of "Bohemian Rhapsody". And I can't really say no to that. Both of these songs are so vulnerable and, they are songs that you can only fully relate to when you've been vulnerable. 

I know I've always got so much to say about "Runaway", but whenever I try to write something about it, I can't. There's so much to say yet nothing to say: words can't describe how I feel about this piece. Some feelings can never be articulated; and for those that could possibly be expressed, I am not sure others would feel the same as I do. At the end of the day, music is a very personal experience -- which is why I recommend you to listen to the song on your own, and if you enjoy it, that's all that matters.

Ironically, this is the exact theme of "Runaway". But I will come back to this later. 

##### Background

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy -- a.k.a the greatest album of 21st century (according to Rolling Stone) -- was made after a lot of mess. In 2007 Kanye lost his mother Donda, the one person he loves and trusts the most. In 2008 he broke up with his fiance who has been together with him since 2002 well before his fame. Few people truly understands the complicated figure of Kanye West, and now he's lost two in one year -- all of a sudden, he's all alone. 

The next year he notoriously interrupted Taylor Swift's speech at the VMA: "But Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time!" I can't decipher the man's mind. Maybe it was his another criticism towards the racism at music awards. Maybe it was a means of catharsis about what he's just been through. Maybe it was the Henny. We don't know. We only know he was heavily criticized after that, became "the abomination in Obama's nation", and went into exile. **This album, especially the single "Runaway", was his redemption.**

#### 1 The Exile

##### Intro

A song's instrumental sets the general "vibe" of the listener's experience, taking them into this world the artist created. What "Runaway" does at the very beginning is to isolate the listener from everything -- as if you are suddenly dragged into this empty room with no one but yourself, and all you hear is a cold and lonely E note echoing in the room, repeatedly strucked 15 times before other notes were played.  

Just as you start to get this impression of seclusion, the beat drops, loud and unrelenting. A menacing "Look at ya!" starts going back and forth between your headphones. It's like somebody turned on the lights in the room, and you find out it's not an empty room but a full hall. You are surrounded by people who are pointing fingers at you, yelling that you should look at yourself. 

It is an odd and uncomfortable experience. Kanye shows us how he felt post-VMAs: being at the center of attention yet cornered and alone. If you have ever been blamed or cold-shouldered by a person or a group of people, this intro might resonate with you too.

##### Verses

A self-imposed exile, "Runaway" is largely about the feeling of desolation, of being misunderstood, of the frustration from failed communication. To understand this, we need to unpack the storyline in the song's verses. It is a story of communication breakdown, between Kanye and a girl going through their breakup, with the girl here being a metaphor for the general public.

In short, verse 1 is Kanye telling us about his breakup; verse 2 is what the girl heard and took away from his words (and she was hurt); verse 3 is what Kanye privately thinks, the words that weren't told. 

>"_She find pictures in my email
>I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
>I don't know what it is with females
>But I'm not too good at that shit
>See, I could have me a good girl
>And still be addicted to them hoodrats
>And I just blame everything on you
>At least you know that's what I'm good at_"



>"_24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
>I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
>Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
>Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
>Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
>Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
>Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
>Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
>You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
>Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
>Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
>You should leave if you can't accept the basics
>Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
>Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
>I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P_"

When I first heard the song this verse was quite off-putting. For such a beautiful, revealing song, Pusha comes on and talks about pussy. The verse itself is very mean too: basically showing no remorse, flexing his wealth and status, and telling the girl to leave cuz he doesn't need her. When I search online, most music analysis says it's the 

**Verse 3**
>"_Never was much of a romantic
>I could never take the intimacy
>And I know I did damage
>'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
>I guess you knew of that advantage
>'Cause you could blame me for everything
>And I don't know how I'ma manage
>If one day, you just up and leave_"


#### 2 The Redemption

Hence the title, Runaway. 

##### Chorus

toast

##### Outro

At this point the song's structure and story is complete. We've . we've raised our glass and had a toast. Drum patterns off, back to the melody echoing in the room. Seems like Kanye's anthem is about to come to an end. 
But no. 


hmmmmmm



#### Review

times i try to communicate with my parents, when i was in sg.

wallow in self pity

if you had any communication breakdown in any sort of relationship, you can relate to runaway. 

i've hurt people and i've been hurt. some apologies were made. some weren't. 
i've argued with people. some issues were solved. some weren't.
i've fell out with people. some of them came back. some didn't.
for those conversations that did work out, i'm grateful that we eventually decided to communicate. to listen and to be listened. 
for those that didn't, i blame nobody. maybe things are meant to happen this way. so lets just raise a glass to toast. to each other and to ourselves.


Sisyphus: 
we can't communicate, but we try to. 
we are assholes and we cant change that, but we celebrate being ourselves.
we are fucked, but we love our life and we love each other.
so let's raise our glass and have a toast, assholes. 



### (scrapped)

#### American Psycho
Few weeks ago I watched American Psycho, definitely my most uncomfortable movie experience. I watched so you don't have to. It gives me nausea and goosebumps at the same time. It's a movie about Patrick Bateman, a young Wall Street elite by day and a psychotic serial killer by night, driven insane by the dystopian materialistic world where people has lost their souls. 

After finishing the movie I couldn't help but kept thinking about that one scene. Bateman breaks up with his girlfriend, because 1. he's afraid he will hurt her one day and 2. they've lost touch. So he tells her, "I need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be corrected but uh... I have no other way to fulfill my needs. We need to talk." 

The girl then turns her head: "Talk about what Patrick?" 

(vid1 - bateman breakup)

One minute later you will see her crying uncontrollably because of the breakup, "What do you want me to do? What is it that you want?" 

It almost feels like they are having two distinct conversations. To Bateman it's about his issues thus his decision to leave. To the girl it's the heartbreak of being dumped. They are both self-absorbed, indulged in their own version of reality. Nobody is really listening.

To me this scene summarizes the entire film: everyone is talking to themselves. It is an exaggerated version of the loneliness we feel in real life, of being misunderstood -- say, you talk about your issues and your insecurities to your friends/partner/parents, but they don't seem to really understand. There is a conversation but no connection. In the end, it's another futile attempt of communication. 


#### The Internet

Now I am going to talk about the Internet. This weird invention changed everything. On one hand, it makes you feel that you are at the center of attention. Technically when you post on Tik Tok, you are showing your video to the world -- and everyone is capable of doing that. We can virtually reach to anywhere in the world. 

On the other hand, the actual attention given to you is, however, much lower. Because of the internet, we are dealing with an unprecedented amount of unrelated, fragmented information everyday. Even if people are just scrolling through other videos in less than 10 seconds -- which is exactly what we are doing btw -- the chance of your video being seen is still extremely low.

This discrepancy has led to this: because we think we deserve to be heard, there is an increased need for expression; but because we are receiving an excess of information, there is a decreased willingness to listen. Eventually everyone starts talking, yet nobody is listening. 

SO here we are: talking to ourselves. 




#### Kanye - DEAD

Few weeks ago Kanye posted a poem called "DEAD". That was really a nice poem, about the same topic I'm discussing here: the feeling of being unheard and muffled. I really wish people could take a moment to feel the emotions being communicated in the poem.

But in the comment section you see @prodbyzaqq flooding in finishing the routine. "Ye the 🐐 no 🧢", "Like if you love Ye", "Ye>>>Skete", "The man just wants his family back..."

Other than that, most people just see the poem as Kanye's defense to his controversial Pete Davidson music video. So there are people who told him to stop being a crybaby about this when he's really the villain. "Stop calling yourself DEAD when you literally killed a man in the music video".

(dead)

Getting used to this digital age is a weird feeling. NYT articles replaced books. Twitter replaced blogs. Tiktok replaced movies. Memes replaced comedy. Hit singles replaced albums. Internet debates where people keep interrupting each other replaced long and organized speeches. We are forced to chop up the information presented to us, from complete to fragmented. Taking the time to feel, to think, to understand, has thus become difficult.

In that Kanye post, I see people who only care about taking sides in this feud, calculating 1 and 0s like machines incapable of processing human emotions. 

The post has a shitload of comments. Ironically, none of the discussion was actually about that poem. And that was exactly: "Won't anyone listen to one word I said? Of course sir, You know how long you been DEAD"
